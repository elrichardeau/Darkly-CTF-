# EXPLANATION

In the robots.txt file, we also discover the existence of a hidden folder “/.hidden”. 
By exploring the folder structure, we discover many directories, each containing a readme file at the end of the hierarchy, with jokes like “ask your neighbor on the left.”

There are far too many to check manually, so we create a Python script for web scraping to collect all the text from the Readme files. In the end, we find the flag: **d5eec3ec36cf80dce44a896f961c1831a05526ec215693c8f2c39543497d4466**.

# SOLUTIONS

Same ones that those of "robots admin exposure"
