In the robots.txt file, we also discover the existence of a hidden folder “/.hidden”. When we access it, we find all sorts of files, including a Readme file that says “Need help? So do I.”

By exploring the folder structure, we discover many directories, each containing a readme file at the end of the hierarchy, with jokes like “ask your neighbor on the left.”

There are far too many to check manually.
