# Darkly 🔐

The **Darkly project** at 42 is built around the concept of a **CTF (Capture The Flag)** designed to help students **discover and exploit common web vulnerabilities** to retrieve flags, in a safe and sandboxed environment. The project is based on a deliberately vulnerable website that simulates real-world security flaws.

This project strengthens our understanding of **web application security, HTTP mechanisms, and backend/frontend interactions**, all of which are crucial for becoming a skilled web developer.

## Features 📋
1. **Vulnerable Web Environment:** Simulates a real website with multiple known security flaws
2. **Common Attacks Practice:** Explore and exploit flaws like:
     - HTTP Header Spoofing
     - Directory Traversal
     - SQL injections
     - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
     - email flooding
4. **No backdoor knowledge required:** The only way to find a flag is to think like a hacker !

## Objectives 🎯
1. Understand how attackers can **exploit insecure web applications**.

2. Learn how to **identify, test, and exploit common vulnerabilities**.

3. Improve our **understanding of how web servers, headers, and request/response cycles work**.

4. Become a more responsible developer by **writing safer code**.

## Web Concepts Explored 🌐
Through hands-on hacking, this project improves understanding of:

- HTTP headers and how they can be manipulated.

- How web servers serve files and how directory traversal exploits poor configuration.

- How to prevent XSS and SQL Injection vulnerabilities in modern web development.

- How email forms and spam protection should be implemented securely.
